Step-by-Step Guide to the Minimax Algorithm in Tic Tac Toe
============================================================

Introduction:
-------------
Tic Tac Toe is a simple game where two players (one using X and the other O) take turns marking a 3x3 grid. The goal is to line up three of your marks in a row, column, or diagonal. To build an unbeatable computer opponent, we use the Minimax algorithm. This method simulates every possible move until the game ends so the computer always picks the best move.

Evaluation Scores:
------------------
- Computer win (O wins): +1
- Computer loss (X wins): -1
- Draw: 0

Board Layout:
-------------
We imagine the board as positions 1 through 9 arranged as follows:

    1 | 2 | 3
   ---+---+---
    4 | 5 | 6
   ---+---+---
    7 | 8 | 9

For example, a board state might be represented as:
    [X, O, X,
     O, X, ' ',
     ' ', ' ', ' ']
In this state, positions 6, 7, 8, and 9 are empty.

How the Minimax Algorithm Works:
---------------------------------

1. Identify Available Moves:
   - The algorithm checks which spots are free.
   - For the above board, available moves: positions 6, 7, 8, and 9.

   Diagram – Current Board:
   --------------------------
       X | O | X
      ---+---+---
       O | X |  
      ---+---+---
         |   |  
   
2. Simulate the Computer's Move (Maximizing Step):
   - It’s the computer’s (O’s) turn. For each available move, the computer pretends to place an O on the board and then evaluates that branch.
   
   Example: Computer considers placing an O in position 6.
   
   Diagram – After O in Position 6:
   ---------------------------------
       X | O | X
      ---+---+---
       O | X | O
      ---+---+---
         |   |  
   
   - Next, the algorithm checks: “Is this a winning move or terminal state?” If not, it simulates the opponent’s turn.

3. Simulate the Opponent's Move (Minimizing Step):
   - After the computer’s move, it’s the opponent’s (X’s) turn. The algorithm evaluates every possible move for X from the new state.
   - For the board after O in position 6, available moves are now positions 7, 8, and 9.

   ------------------------------------------
   Option A: X in Position 7
   
       X | O | X
      ---+---+---
       O | X | O
      ---+---+---
       X |   |  
   
   Option B: X in Position 8
   
       X | O | X
      ---+---+---
       O | X | O
      ---+---+---
         | X |  
   
   Option C: X in Position 9
   
       X | O | X
      ---+---+---
       O | X | O
      ---+---+---
         |   | X

4. Recursion and Terminal Evaluation:
   - The algorithm recursively simulates moves for both players until a terminal state is reached:
       • Terminal conditions include a win for O (+1), a win for X (-1), or a draw (0).
   - At each terminal node, the board is evaluated:
   
   Example Terminal Cases:
   ------------------------
   a) If any branch results in three O's in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), that branch returns +1.
   b) If a branch ends with three X's in a row, that branch returns -1.
   c) If no winning combination is found and the board fills up, the branch returns 0.

5. Backtracking the Scores:
   - Once a terminal state is reached, the algorithm backtracks, choosing scores at each level:
     - During the computer’s turn, it picks the move with the maximum score.
     - During the opponent’s turn, it picks the move with the minimum score (as the opponent is assumed to be trying to minimize the computer’s score).
   
   Diagram – Backtracking Example:
   -------------------------------
   Suppose from O at position 6:
     - Option A (X at 7) leads eventually to a score of -1.
     - Option B (X at 8) leads to a score of 0.
     - Option C (X at 9) leads to a score of +1.
   
   Since X is the opponent and would choose the move that minimizes O's outcome, if X had the choice, they would choose Option A (score -1). Therefore, the computer assumes the worst-case scenario for that branch is -1.

6. Making the Best Decision:
   - The computer evaluates all possible moves (e.g., positions 6, 7, 8, and 9) using the minimax process.
   - It then selects the move with the highest minimax score.
   - This ensures the best outcome for the computer, assuming optimal play from both sides.

Putting It All Together – A Complete Walkthrough:
--------------------------------------------------
Initial Board:
    [X, O, X,
     O, X, ' ',
     ' ', ' ', ' ']

Diagram – Initial Board:
   ------------------------
       X | O | X
      ---+---+---
       O | X |  
      ---+---+---
         |   |  

Assume it is O’s turn.

A. Evaluating Move at Position 6:
   1. Place O at Position 6:
      
          [X, O, X,
           O, X, O,
           ' ', ' ', ' ']
      
      Diagram:
         X | O | X
        ---+---+---
         O | X | O
        ---+---+---
           |   |  

   2. Now, X’s possible responses:
      - **Response A1:** X in Position 7:
        
             [X, O, X,
              O, X, O,
              X, ' ', ' ']
        
        Diagram:
           X | O | X
          ---+---+---
           O | X | O
          ---+---+---
           X |   |  
        
        Evaluation: Assume this branch eventually gives X a win → score -1.
      
      - **Response A2:** X in Position 8:
        
             [X, O, X,
              O, X, O,
              ' ', X, ' ']
        
        Diagram:
           X | O | X
          ---+---+---
           O | X | O
          ---+---+---
             | X |  
        
        Evaluation: Assume further play leads to a draw → score 0.
      
      - **Response A3:** X in Position 9:
        
             [X, O, X,
              O, X, O,
              ' ', ' ', X]
        
        Diagram:
           X | O | X
          ---+---+---
           O | X | O
          ---+---+---
             |   | X
        
        Evaluation: Assume this branch eventually gives O the win → score +1.
      
   3. Since X is the minimizer, it will choose the move that gives the lowest score. Here, the worst outcome is -1.
   4. Therefore, the move at position 6 would yield an evaluated score of -1 for O (in the worst-case scenario).

B. Evaluating Other Moves:
   - The algorithm performs similar evaluations for moves at positions 7, 8, and 9.
   - Each move creates its own tree of responses and outcomes.
   - Finally, O compares the minimax scores from each branch and selects the move with the highest score.

Conclusion:
-----------
By simulating every possible move and counter-move and by evaluating the resulting outcomes using a simple scoring system (-1 for a loss, 0 for a draw, and +1 for a win), the Minimax algorithm ensures that the computer plays optimally. The added diagrams help visualize how each move branches out and how the evaluation flows back up the decision tree to determine the best move.
