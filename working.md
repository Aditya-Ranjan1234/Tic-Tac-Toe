# Step-by-Step Guide to the Minimax Algorithm in Tic Tac Toe

## Introduction

Tic Tac Toe is a simple game where two players (one using **X** and the other **O**) take turns marking a 3x3 grid. The goal is to line up three of your marks in a row, column, or diagonal. To build an unbeatable computer opponent, we use the **Minimax algorithm**. This method simulates every possible move until the game ends so the computer always picks the best move.

## Evaluation Scores

- **Computer win (O wins):** +1
- **Computer loss (X wins):** -1
- **Draw:** 0

## Board Layout

Imagine the board as positions 1 through 9 arranged like this:

```
  1 | 2 | 3
 ---+---+---
  4 | 5 | 6
 ---+---+---
  7 | 8 | 9
```

For example, a board state might be represented as:

```
[X, O, X,
 O, X, ' ',
 ' ', ' ', ' ']
```

In this state, positions 6, 7, 8, and 9 are empty.

## How the Minimax Algorithm Works

### 1. Identify Available Moves

The algorithm first checks which spots are free.  
- For the above board, available moves: positions 6, 7, 8, and 9.

**Diagram – Current Board:**

```
  X | O | X
 ---+---+---
  O | X |  
 ---+---+---
    |   |  
```

---

### 2. Simulate the Computer's Move (Maximizing Step)

It’s the computer’s turn (playing **O**). For each available move, the computer pretends to place an **O** on the board and then evaluates that branch.

**Example:** The computer considers placing an **O** in position **6**.

**Diagram – After O in Position 6:**

```
  X | O | X
 ---+---+---
  O | X | O
 ---+---+---
    |   |  
```

Next, the algorithm checks: “Is this a winning move or a terminal state?” If not, it simulates the opponent’s turn.

---

### 3. Simulate the Opponent's Move (Minimizing Step)

After the computer’s move, it’s the opponent’s turn (playing **X**). The algorithm evaluates every possible move for **X** from the new state.

For the board after **O** in position 6, available moves are now positions **7**, **8**, and **9**.

**Diagrams – Branching from O at Position 6:**

- **Option A: X in Position 7**

```
  X | O | X
 ---+---+---
  O | X | O
 ---+---+---
  X |   |  
```

- **Option B: X in Position 8**

```
  X | O | X
 ---+---+---
  O | X | O
 ---+---+---
    | X |  
```

- **Option C: X in Position 9**

```
  X | O | X
 ---+---+---
  O | X | O
 ---+---+---
    |   | X
```

---

### 4. Recursion and Terminal Evaluation

The algorithm recursively simulates moves for both players until a terminal state is reached:

- **Win for O:** Score = **+1**
- **Win for X:** Score = **-1**
- **Draw:** Score = **0**

**Example Terminal Cases:**

- If any branch results in three **O**’s in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), that branch returns **+1**.
- If a branch ends with three **X**’s in a row, that branch returns **-1**.
- If the board fills up with no winner, the branch returns **0**.

---

### 5. Backtracking the Scores

Once a terminal state is reached, the algorithm backtracks and chooses scores at each level:
- During the computer’s turn (maximizing), it picks the move with the **highest score**.
- During the opponent’s turn (minimizing), it picks the move with the **lowest score**.

**Diagram – Backtracking Example:**

From the branch where **O** is in position 6:
- **Response A (X in 7)** leads to a branch score of **-1**.
- **Response B (X in 8)** leads to a branch score of **0**.
- **Response C (X in 9)** leads to a branch score of **+1**.

Since the opponent (X) is minimizing, it would choose the move that results in the lowest score (**-1**). Thus, the evaluated score for the move at position 6 is **-1** in the worst-case scenario.

---

### 6. Making the Best Decision

The algorithm repeats similar evaluations for each available move (positions 6, 7, 8, and 9). After comparing all the minimax scores, the computer selects the move with the highest value. This ensures the best possible outcome—maximizing its chances to win or at least draw—when both sides play optimally.

## A Complete Walkthrough

### Initial Board

```
[X, O, X,
 O, X, ' ',
 ' ', ' ', ' ']
```

**Diagram – Initial Board:**

```
  X | O | X
 ---+---+---
  O | X |  
 ---+---+---
    |   |  
```

Assume it is **O**’s turn.

### Evaluating Move at Position 6

1. **Place O at Position 6:**

```
[X, O, X,
 O, X, O,
 ' ', ' ', ' ']
```

**Diagram:**

```
  X | O | X
 ---+---+---
  O | X | O
 ---+---+---
    |   |  
```

2. **Simulate X’s Possible Responses:**

- **Response A:** X in Position 7

```
[X, O, X,
 O, X, O,
 X, ' ', ' ']
```

**Diagram:**

```
  X | O | X
 ---+---+---
  O | X | O
 ---+---+---
  X |   |  
```

Evaluation: Assume this branch eventually results in a win for **X**, score = **-1**.

- **Response B:** X in Position 8

```
[X, O, X,
 O, X, O,
 ' ', X, ' ']
```

**Diagram:**

```
  X | O | X
 ---+---+---
  O | X | O
 ---+---+---
    | X |  
```

Evaluation: Assume further play leads to a draw, score = **0**.

- **Response C:** X in Position 9

```
[X, O, X,
 O, X, O,
 ' ', ' ', X]
```

**Diagram:**

```
  X | O | X
 ---+---+---
  O | X | O
 ---+---+---
    |   | X
```

Evaluation: Assume this branch eventually results in a win for **O**, score = **+1**.

3. **Backtracking:**

Since the opponent minimizes the outcome, they would choose **Response A** (score **-1**).  
Thus, the evaluated score for move at position 6 is **-1**.

4. **Evaluating Other Moves:**

The algorithm performs similar evaluations for moves at positions 7, 8, and 9. Ultimately, the computer selects the move with the highest minimax score.

---

## Conclusion

The Minimax algorithm systematically simulates every possible move and counter-move, scoring outcomes as follows:
- **+1** for a win,
- **-1** for a loss,
- **0** for a draw.

By evaluating the game tree and backtracking these scores, the computer always picks the move that maximizes its chances of winning (or drawing), even when facing an optimal opponent.
